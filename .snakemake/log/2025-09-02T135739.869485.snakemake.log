MissingOutputException in rule crassify in file /home/administrator/phd/crassify_v2/Snakefile, line 33:
Job 2  completed successfully, but some output files are missing. Missing files after 5 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:
/home/administrator/phd/feature_metadata.tsv
Removing output files of failed job crassify since they might be corrupted:
/home/administrator/phd/percentage_viral.csv
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
